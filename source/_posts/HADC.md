HDAC inhibition increases proinflammatory gene expression in keratinocytes
Butyrate is an SCFA that is produced by anaerobic fermentation and is known to be a potent inhibitor of HDAC activity (21). Through the production of butyrate, the microbiome has been suggested to exert epigenetic control of immune behaviors by modulating histone acetylation, acting to suppress cytokine production by cells like macrophages and dendritic cells (5–8). Consistent with this notion, we observed that the expression of mRNA for interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor–α (TNFα), IL-8, and chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2) induced by the TLR2/6 ligand macrophage-activating lipopeptide 2 (MALP-2) was significantly decreased in human monocytes when exposed to sodium butyrate (Fig.1A). However, in contrast to the response of monocytes and other bone marrow–derived immunocytes previously studied, primary cultures of normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEKs) significantly increased the expression of these same cytokines and chemokines when exposed to equivalent concentrations of sodium butyrate and MALP-2 (Fig. 1B).

Fig. 1 Butyrate inhibits TLR-induced cytokine production from monocytes while increasing cytokine expression in keratinocytes.
Human monocytes or keratinocytes were incubated in culture medium ± sodium butyrate (2 mM) for 1 hour and subsequently stimulated with TLR ligands. (A) Cytokine mRNA expression in monocytes stimulated with MALP-2 (200 ng/ml) for 4 hours [n = 3; P < 0.0001 (IL-6), P = 0.0052 (TNF), P < 0.0001 (IL-8), P = 0.0004 (CCL2); one-way ANOVA]. (B) Cytokine mRNA expression in keratinocytes stimulated with MALP-2 for 4 hours [n = 3; P = 0.0008 (IL-6), P < 0.0001 (TNF), P < 0.0001 (IL-8), P = 0.005 (CCL2); one-way ANOVA]. (C) IL-6 and IL-8 mRNA expression in keratinocytes stimulated with MALP-2 or poly(I:C) (1 μg/ml) for 4 hours [n = 3; P = 0.9929, P < 0.0001, and P = 0.0117 (IL-6); P = 0.6314, P < 0.0001, and P < 0.0001 (IL-8); one-way ANOVA]. (D and E) IL-6 and IL-8 levels in culture supernatants of keratinocytes stimulated with MALP-2 or poly(I:C) for 24 hours [n = 4; P = 0.7438, P < 0.0001, and P < 0.0001 (IL-6); P = 0.7028, P = 0.0003, and P < 0.0001 (IL-8); one-way ANOVA]. (F) Secreted protein concentration from keratinocytes stimulated with MALP-2 (100 ng/ml) for 24 hours, normalized to untreated cells [n = 3; P < 0.0001 (IL-6), P < 0.0001 (IL-8), and P = 0.0009 (RANTES); one-way ANOVA]. (G and H) IL-6 and IL-8 levels in culture supernatants of keratinocytes treated with MALP-2 (200 ng/ml) with increasing concentrations of sodium butyrate for 24 hours [n = 3; P = 0.019 (IL-6 control); P < 0.0001 (IL-6 MALP-2); P = 0.0262 (IL-8 control); P = 0.0004 and P < 0.0001 (IL-8 MALP-2); two-way ANOVA]. All data are means ± SEM and representative of at least three experiments.
The large magnitude of this unexpected proinflammatory response brought on by HDAC inhibition in keratinocytes prompted us to further characterize how HDAC inhibitors affect TLR responses in NHEKs. Polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid [poly(I:C)] is a ligand of TLR3 and is a potent inflammatory stimulus that models cutaneous immune responses to tissue necrosis and viral infections (22). Butyrate also increased NHEK IL-6 and IL-8 mRNA expression when exposed to this TLR3 ligand (Fig. 1C). The abundance of IL-6 and IL-8 protein secreted into the culture medium was also increased by butyrate exposure combined with either TLR ligand (Fig. 1, D and E). Multiplex analysis of several other cytokines and chemokines demonstrated that chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 5 (CCL5/RANTES) was also increased when keratinocytes were cotreated with butyrate and MALP-2, but monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1), IL-1α, IL-1β, interferon gamma-induced protein 10 (IP-10/CXCL10), and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) were not (Fig. 1F). The effect of sodium butyrate on secretion of IL-6 and IL-8 was dose-dependent, with significant increases observed across micromolar to millimolar concentration ranges (Fig. 1, G and H). Similar stimulatory effects were also seen when cells were treated with other HDAC inhibitors, including trichostatin A and suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (fig. S1, A to D). These results demonstrated that multiple different chemical inhibitors of HDAC activity increased inflammatory cytokine responses by cutaneous epithelial cells and supported the conclusion that the effect observed with sodium butyrate was due to the capacity of this SCFA to inhibit HDACs and not due to another response to this lipid.
To understand why inhibition of HDAC activity had an opposite effect on cytokine production in keratinocytes compared with bone marrow–derived immunocytes, we examined the role of the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase (NuRD) complex. In macrophages, the NuRD complex acts as a negative regulator of inflammatory gene expression (23, 24). It was previously reported that in these cells, HDAC inhibitors increase both the expression and the chromatin-binding activity of Mi-2β/CHD4, the catalytic subunit of the NuRD complex (6). However, in contrast to monocytes, butyrate treatment did not increase Mi-2β transcript levels in keratinocytes (fig. S2A). Furthermore, contrary to the reported increases in Mi-2β/NuRD binding to the IL-6 promoter in macrophages after HDAC inhibition, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)–quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis revealed no increases in Mi-2β binding to the IL-6 promoter in keratinocytes treated with sodium butyrate (fig. S2B). These results demonstrated that, unlike monocytes or macrophages, keratinocytes lack the negative regulatory action that accompanies Mi-2β/NuRD activation by HDAC inhibitors.

这段话中提到了一项研究，探讨了HDAC抑制剂对角质形成细胞（角质细胞）和单核细胞（单核细胞）的影响，特别是对于炎症因子的表达。研究发现，丁酸（一种SCFA，通过厌氧发酵产生）是HDAC活性的有效抑制剂。在单核细胞中，丁酸抑制了TLR2/6配体（MALP-2）引发的细胞因子（IL-6、TNFα、IL-8和CCL2）的表达，从而抑制了炎症反应。然而，在角质细胞中，丁酸和MALP-2共同作用却显著增加了这些细胞因子的表达。类似的结果也观察到了在角质细胞中使用TLR3配体（poly(I:C)）时。这表明HDAC抑制剂在角质细胞中会增强炎症反应。

研究进一步调查了为什么HDAC抑制剂对角质细胞和骨髓源性免疫细胞的炎症因子表达产生相反的效果。研究发现，在巨噬细胞中，核小体重塑和去乙酰化酶（NuRD）复合物充当炎症基因表达的负调控因子。然而，在角质细胞中，HDAC抑制剂对Mi-2β/CHD4（NuRD复合物的催化亚单位）的表达和染色质结合活性没有增加。这说明角质细胞缺乏HDAC抑制剂激活Mi-2β/NuRD复合物所伴随的负调控作用。

总结起来，这项研究表明HDAC抑制剂对角质细胞和单核细胞的炎症反应产生了不同的效果。在单核细胞中，HDAC抑制剂抑制了炎症因子的表达，而在角质细胞中却增强了炎症因子的表达。这种差异可能与NuRD复合物在不同细胞类型中的作用有关。角质细胞缺乏HDAC抑制剂激活Mi-2β/NuRD复合物的负调控作用，可能是导致这种差异的原因之一。这项研究对于理解HDAC抑制剂在不同细胞类型中的作用机制以及炎症调节的分子基础具有重要意义。

HDAC8 and HDAC9 control inflammatory gene expression in keratinocytes
The HDAC inhibitors used in these experiments are broad-acting and inhibit the activity of many of the 11 classical HDAC enzymes. We next sought to gain a better understanding of which particular HDACs are responsible for controlling proinflammatory gene expression in keratinocytes. We measured the transcript abundance of 11 HDACs in keratinocytes grown under conditions that mimic their state of differentiation in the basal layer of the epidermis and then again after switching to a high-calcium medium to promote differentiation to a state more reflective of keratinocytes in the superficial layers of the skin. We observed that HDAC2, HDAC3, HDAC8, HDAC9, and HDAC10 were the most highly expressed overall but that HDAC8, HDAC9, and HDAC10 showed differential expression during differentiation (Fig. 2A). Expression of HDAC8 and HDAC9 in basal and differentiated epidermal keratinocytes was further validated by Western blot analysis (fig. S3A). Additionally, expression levels of the 11 HDAC enzymes were measured in a sebocyte cell line and compared with epidermal keratinocytes (fig. S3B).

Fig. 2 HDAC8 and HDAC9 control inflammatory gene expression in keratinocytes.
(A) Expression levels of 11 HDAC enzymes in basal or calcium-differentiated keratinocytes, normalized to GAPDH (n = 3). (B) Expression of HDAC8 and HDAC9 in keratinocytes after siRNA-mediated gene knockdown [n = 3; P = 0.0008 (HDAC8), P < 0.0001 (HDAC9); one-way ANOVA]. (C to E) Levels of IL-6, IL-8, and CCL5 expression in keratinocytes treated with siRNA specific for HDAC8 or HDAC9, stimulated with MALP-2 for 4 hours [n = 3; P = 0.0034 and P < 0.0001 (IL-6); P = 0.0237 and P = 0.0019 (IL-8); P < 0.0001 (CCL5); two-way ANOVA]. (F to H) Normal human skin sections were stained with anti-HDAC8 (F) or anti-HDAC9 (G and H) antibodies (red) as indicated, and nuclei were counterstained with DAPI (blue). Scale bars, 100 μm. Zoom-in pictures of HDAC8 or HDAC9 staining in epidermal keratinocytes or in the follicular keratinocytes surrounding the hair follicle are highlighted in yellow boxes. White dashed line indicates the epidermal/dermal junction. All data are means ± SEM and representative of at least three experiments.
We next used small interfering RNA (siRNA)–mediated gene knockdown to systematically deplete these highly abundant HDACs in cultured keratinocytes, resulting in 90% or greater reduction in transcript levels (Fig. 2B and fig. S4A). Similar to the response to broad-acting chemical inhibitors of HDAC activity, silencing of either HDAC8 or HDAC9 led to a robust increase in the TLR2/6-mediated induction of IL-6, IL-8, and CCL5 (Fig. 2, C to E). However, silencing of HDAC1, HDAC2, and HDAC3 did not consistently lead to increases in the responsiveness of keratinocytes to MALP-2 (fig. S4, B to D). These observations suggested that the proinflammatory actions of SCFA were mediated by inhibition of HDAC8 and HDAC9. These HDACs have not been well studied in the skin and were not previously known to influence immune function. Therefore, to better understand the potential role of HDAC8 and HDAC9 in keratinocytes, the expression of these enzymes was studied by immunostaining of normal human skin. Both HDAC8 and HDAC9 were abundantly detected in the epidermis, with HDAC8 staining throughout the epidermis, whereas HDAC9 was primarily expressed in basal layers (Fig. 2, F and G). HDAC9 was highly expressed by keratinocytes lining hair follicles (Fig. 2H), a site that is abundantly colonized by P. acnes and can provide the lipid-rich and hypoxic environment necessary for the production of SCFAs (25). These results therefore suggested that HDAC8 and HDAC9 have relevant functions as negative regulators of inflammatory gene expression in the skin and that inhibition of this tolerogenic activity can promote epithelial inflammation.

这段话中提到了HDAC8和HDAC9在角质细胞中控制炎症基因表达的作用。研究使用广谱作用的HDAC抑制剂来阻断多种经典HDAC酶的活性。接下来，研究人员测量了在模拟表皮基底层角质细胞分化状态的条件下生长的角质细胞中11种HDAC的转录丰度，并在切换到高钙培养基以促进分化为更反映表皮浅层角质细胞状态的情况下再次进行测量。结果显示，HDAC2、HDAC3、HDAC8、HDAC9和HDAC10在总体上表达最高，但HDAC8、HDAC9和HDAC10在分化过程中显示出差异表达。通过Western blot分析进一步验证了HDAC8和HDAC9在基底层和分化表皮角质细胞中的表达。此外，还在一个皮脂细胞系中测量了11种HDAC酶的表达水平，并与表皮角质细胞进行了比较。

接下来，研究使用小干扰RNA（siRNA）介导的基因敲除系统地减少了这些丰富的HDACs在培养的角质细胞中的表达，结果导致转录水平减少90%或更多。类似于广谱HDAC化学抑制剂对HDAC活性的作用，静默HDAC8或HDAC9会显著增加TLR2/6介导的IL-6、IL-8和CCL5的诱导作用。然而，静默HDAC1、HDAC2和HDAC3并没有一致地增加角质细胞对MALP-2的响应。这些观察结果表明，丁酸的炎症作用是通过抑制HDAC8和HDAC9介导的。这些HDAC在皮肤中研究较少，之前未知它们对免疫功能的影响。因此，为了更好地了解HDAC8和HDAC9在角质细胞中的潜在作用，研究人员通过免疫染色检测了正常人皮肤中这些酶的表达。结果显示，HDAC8和HDAC9在表皮中大量检测到，HDAC8在整个表皮中表达，而HDAC9主要在基底层表达。HDAC9在包围毛囊的角质细胞中高表达，该区域大量富集了痤疮丙酸杆菌，并提供了产生短链脂肪酸所需的富含脂质和低氧环境。因此，这些结果表明HDAC8和HDAC9在皮肤中作为炎症基因表达的负调节因子具有相关功能，并且抑制这种耐受性活性可以促进上皮炎症。

A commensal skin microbe inhibits HDAC activity
Having observed that the SCFA butyrate can enhance keratinocyte cytokine expression, we next directly tested whether the SCFAs made by P. acnes could influence HDAC activity. To measure HDAC inhibition by the SCFAs made by P. acnes, two laboratory strains of P. acnes (ATCC6919 and ATCC29399) were grown anaerobically with and without 2% glycerol as a lipid substrate for fermentation. Bacterial supernatants were then collected, filtered, and used to stimulate keratinocytes in culture. The supernatants from bacteria grown in the presence of glycerol elicited increased production of the cytokines IL-6, IL-8, TSLP (thymic stromal lymphopoietin), and TNFα when compared with those from bacteria grown without the glycerol substrate (Fig. 3, A to D). Furthermore, an assessment of acetylation of histone residues H3K9 and H3K27 by Western blot analysis demonstrated that supernatants from P. acnes cultured with glycerol led to higher increases in levels of acetylation of these histone marks in keratinocytes (Fig. 3E). Supernatants of P. acnes ATCC6919 cultured with glycerol increased H3K9 and H3K27 acetylation (9.2- and 2.7-fold over control, respectively) more than when cultured without glycerol (4.3- and 1.7-fold over control, respectively). Similarly, ATCC29399 cultured with glycerol led to larger increases in H3K9 and H3K27 acetylation (9.4- and 2.3-fold over control, respectively) than when cultured without glycerol (5.4- and 1.3-fold over control, respectively) (fig. S5, A and B).

Fig. 3 P. acnes enhances cytokine expression from keratinocytes when cultured in fermentation-favoring conditions.
Culture supernatants of P. acnes (ATCC6919 and ATCC29399, grown in anaerobic conditions with or without 2% glycerol for 14 days) were added to EpiLife medium at 25% and used to stimulate keratinocytes for 4 hours. (A to D) mRNA expression levels of IL-6, IL-8, TSLP, and TNFα, normalized to GAPDH [n = 3; P = 0.7146 and P < 0.0001 (IL-6); P = 0.0305 and P = 0.0106 (IL-8); P = 0.0558 and P < 0.0001 (TSLP); P = 0.0004 and P = 0.0109 (TNF); one-way ANOVA]. (E) Western blot analysis of histone acetylation in keratinocytes after stimulation with P. acnes supernatants. All data are means ± SEM and representative of at least two experiments. n.s., not significant.
Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis of the SCFAs produced by P. acnes cultured with glycerol revealed that these strains of P. acnes most abundantly produced the SCFAs propionate and isovalerate (Table 1). These SCFAs were next directly tested for their capacity to alter histone acetylation. As seen with crude culture supernatants, increased acetylation of histone H3 lysine residues H3K9 and H3K27 was observed in keratinocytes after treatment with propionate (3.6- and 5.2-fold, respectively), butyrate (9.7- and 13.2-fold, respectively), or valerate (5.0- and 6.0-fold, respectively) but not acetate (1.6- and 2.0-fold, respectively) (Fig. 4A and fig. S5C). Furthermore, as seen with butyrate, addition of propionate or valerate (but not acetate) also increased TLR2/6-mediated induction of IL-6 and IL-8 transcript and protein levels (Fig. 4, B to E). Consistent with this observation, ChIP analysis of H3K9ac also confirmed increased association with the promoter region of IL-6 in keratinocytes after butyrate treatment (Fig. 4F). These results demonstrated that changes in levels of histone acetylation correlated with increased transcriptional activity of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in keratinocytes.

Fig. 4 SCFA-induced increases in cytokine expression in keratinocytes are mediated through HDAC inhibition.
Keratinocytes were treated with sodium acetate, sodium propionate, sodium butyrate, or valeric acid (2 mM) ± MALP-2 (200 ng/ml) for 4 to 24 hours. (A) Western blot analysis of H3K9 and H3K27 acetylation after 4 hours of SCFA treatment. (B and C) IL-6 and IL-8 mRNA expression in keratinocytes cultured with SCFAs and MALP-2 for 4 hours [n = 3; P = 0.9996, P = 0.9996, and P = 0.9997 (IL-6 control); P < 0.0001, P < 0.0001, and P = 0.0004 (IL-6 MALP-2); P > 0.9999 (IL-8 control); P < 0.0001, P < 0.0001, and P = 0.0002 (IL-8 MALP-2); two-way ANOVA]. (D and E) IL-6 and IL-8 levels in culture medium from keratinocytes cultured with SCFAs and MALP-2 for 24 hours [n = 4; P = 0.9724, P = 0.8748, P = 0.014, and P = 0.1161 (IL-6 control); P = 0.6648 and P < 0.0001 (IL-6 MALP-2); P = 0.9929, P = 0.9884, P = 0.6105, and P = 0.9582 (IL-8 control); P = 0.892, P = 0.0001, P = 0.0052, and P < 0.0001 (IL-8 MALP-2); two-way ANOVA]. All data are means ± SEM and representative of at least three experiments. (F) ChIP was performed using antibody against acetylated H3K9 in keratinocytes treated with MALP-2 and sodium butyrate for 2 hours. Precipitated DNA was analyzed by RT-qPCR for regions of the IL-6 promoter (n = 1, representative of two experiments).
To explore potential effects of SCFAs not related to histone acetylation, we examined activation of alternate proinflammatory signaling pathways in keratinocytes. Previous reports have identified various membrane-bound G protein (heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide–binding protein)–coupled receptors (GPCRs) as physiological receptors for SCFAs and have attributed some of the effects of SCFAs on inflammatory gene expression to activation of these GPCRs (26–28). Blocking the signaling of membrane-bound free fatty acid receptors with pertussis toxin (PTX) failed to abrogate the SCFA-mediated increase of TLR-mediated cytokine expression in keratinocytes (fig. S6, A to C). Additionally, in cultured epidermal keratinocytes, the expression levels of GPR41, GPR43, and GPR109a were extremely low, suggesting that these molecules do not increase cytokine response through GPCR activation (fig. S6D). Furthermore, propionate and butyrate had no effect on basal or TLR2/6-induced phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), p38, or nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) p65 and p105 subunits (fig. S6E). Taken in combination with our early data showing that SCFA treatment alone does not induce inflammatory gene expression, we concluded that these SCFAs were not directly affecting proinflammatory signaling pathways in keratinocytes. Together, these results show that when SCFAs are made under environmental conditions favoring fermentation, they will increase histone acetylation and enhance cytokine production.

这段话中描述了共生皮肤微生物P. acnes产生的短链脂肪酸（SCFA）如何影响HDAC活性和角质细胞的细胞因子表达。研究人员通过将两株P. acnes培养在含有2％甘油作为发酵的脂质底物的条件下，收集其培养上清液，经过过滤后用于刺激培养中的角质细胞。与未添加甘油底物的菌株相比，含有甘油底物的菌株的上清液在诱导角质细胞产生IL-6、IL-8、TSLP（胸腺基质淋巴瘤多肽）和TNFα等细胞因子方面表现出增强的效果。此外，通过Western blot分析组蛋白残基H3K9和H3K27的乙酰化水平，发现含有甘油培养的P. acnes上清液导致角质细胞中这些组蛋白标记的乙酰化水平升高。使用GC-MS分析发现，含有甘油培养的P. acnes主要产生丙酸盐和异戊酸盐这两种SCFA。研究进一步测试了这些SCFA对组蛋白乙酰化的影响。实验结果显示，与原始培养上清液相似，丙酸盐、丁酸盐和异戊酸盐处理后，角质细胞中的H3K9和H3K27组蛋白乙酰化水平增加。此外，丙酸盐和异戊酸盐处理还增强了TLR2/6介导的IL-6和IL-8基因转录和蛋白水平的诱导。ChIP分析进一步证实，丁酸盐处理后，H3K9乙酰化与IL-6启动子区域的结合增加。这些结果表明，组蛋白乙酰化水平的变化与角质细胞中促炎细胞因子和趋化因子的转录活性增加相关。

研究还探讨了SCFA对角质细胞中与组蛋白乙酰化无关的其他促炎信号通路的影响。以往的研究已经确定了各种膜结合型G蛋白偶联受体（GPCRs）作为SCFA的生理受体，并将SCFA对炎症基因表达的某些效应归因于这些GPCRs的活化。然而，阻断膜结合型游离脂肪酸受体的信号传导并不能消除SCFA介导的角质细胞中TLR介导的细胞因子表达增加。此外，培养的表皮角质细胞中GPR41、GPR43和GPR109a的表达水平极低，这表明这些分子不通过GPCR的活化增加细胞因子反应。此外，丙酸盐和丁酸盐对c-Jun N末端激酶（JNK）、p38或核因子κB（NF-κB）p65和p105亚基的基础或TLR2/6诱导的磷酸化没有影响。综合早期的数据表明，SCFA单独处理不能诱导炎症基因表达，研究人员得出结论，这些SCFA并不直接影响角质细胞中的促炎信号通路。综上所述，这些结果表明，当SCFA在有利于发酵的环境条件下产生时，它们会增加组蛋白乙酰化，并增强细胞因子的产生。

Inhibition of HDAC activity enhances the host defense response of the skin
RNA-sequencing analysis was next used to gain a clearer understanding of the transcriptome-wide effects of HDAC inhibition on keratinocytes. We analyzed the effects of TLR2/6 stimulation in keratinocytes. Using a fold-change cutoff of 1.5 compared with control conditions, we identified 387 genes that were up-regulated and 68 genes that were down-regulated after 4 hours of exposure to MALP-2 (Fig. 5A). Simultaneous treatment with butyrate led to further induction of 29% of the genes induced by TLR activation and also significantly enhanced the expression of nearly half of the genes down-regulated by MALP-2 (Fig. 5B). Gene Ontology analysis of the genes that were most significantly enriched by butyrate compared with stimulation with TLR2/6 ligand alone highlighted an increased response to wounding, immune response, inflammatory response, and defense response as the biological processes most enriched (Fig. 5C).

Fig. 5 Up-regulation of inflammatory- and immune response–related genes in keratinocytes by butyrate.
RNA sequencing was performed on keratinocytes stimulated with MALP-2 (200 ng/ml) with or without butyrate (2 mM) for 4 hours. (A) Identification of genes up- and down-regulated (fold change > 1.5 versus control) by MALP-2 stimulation in keratinocytes. (B) Analysis of the effects of butyrate treatment on gene sets modulated by MALP-2 (enhancement: fold change > 1.5 in butyrate + MALP-2 versus vehicle + MALP-2; inhibition: fold change < −1.5 in butyrate + MALP-2 versus vehicle + MALP-2; no effect: −1.5 < fold change < 1.5). (C) Gene Ontology analysis of the MALP-2–induced genes, of which expression was further increased by butyrate treatment in keratinocytes. The number of genes related to each biological process is indicated in parentheses.
To determine whether enhanced host defense in epithelial cells could also occur in vivo, we measured the skin cytokine response of mice after cutaneous exposure to propionate or butyrate. In the setting of a normal cutaneous microbiome, topical application of propionate or butyrate led to the induction of IL-1β, IL-6, CXCL1, CXCL2, and TSLP expression (Fig. 6A). This enhanced cytokine response in vivo was consistent with the observed effects of HDAC inhibitors on cultured keratinocytes but opposite to that previously reported for macrophages. Therefore, to evaluate whether the response was determined by the route of exposure, we subcutaneously exposed mice to propionate and P. acnes. Under these conditions, propionate led to a modest decrease in the P. acnes–mediated induction of these same inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (Fig. 6B). Together, these results support our in vitro data that demonstrate a cell type–specific effect of SCFAs and other HDAC inhibitors, namely, that epidermal keratinocytes display an increased responsiveness to TLR activation when HDAC activity is inhibited, contrary to the anti-inflammatory effect of HDAC inhibition in monocytes.

All data are means ± SEM and representative of at least two experiments.

这段话描述了对角质细胞中HDAC抑制对转录组的影响以及SCFA（例如丁酸盐）在体内对皮肤宿主防御响应的增强作用。

首先，通过RNA测序分析角质细胞中HDAC抑制对转录组的影响。研究发现，在TLR2/6刺激下，与对照组相比，有387个基因上调表达，68个基因下调表达。同时使用丁酸盐进行处理进一步诱导了29％的基因，这些基因是TLR激活引起的，并且显著增强了近一半被MALP-2下调的基因的表达。基因本体论分析显示，与单独刺激TLR2/6配体相比，丁酸盐处理最显著富集的生物学过程包括伤口应答、免疫应答、炎症反应和防御反应。

其次，研究评估了SCFA在体内对皮肤细胞防御响应的影响。在正常皮肤微生物组的情况下，局部涂抹丙酸盐或丁酸盐导致IL-1β、IL-6、CXCL1、CXCL2和TSLP的表达增加。这种增强的细胞因子反应与培养的角质细胞中HDAC抑制剂的观察效应一致，但与巨噬细胞的抗炎效应相反。为了评估这种响应是否由暴露途径决定，研究将丙酸盐和P. acnes皮下注射到小鼠体内。在这种条件下，丙酸盐对P. acnes介导的炎症细胞因子和趋化因子的诱导产生了轻微的降低。综合这些结果支持了体外数据，即当HDAC活性受到抑制时，表皮角质细胞对TLR激活表现出增强的反应能力，与单核细胞中HDAC抑制的抗炎效应相反。

综上所述，这些研究结果表明HDAC抑制剂和SCFA对皮肤细胞具有细胞类型特异性的影响，并且可以增强角质细胞的防御响应。
