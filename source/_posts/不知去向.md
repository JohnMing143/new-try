“当她的嘴唇和他的脖子接触时，连空气中的分子都产生了奇妙的压缩，那是一个很短暂且重要的瞬间，像苹果击中牛顿，像光看见爱因斯坦，然后低吟着爆发出燃烧的火焰，震动着变成波和能量，以至于后来他们回顾那一刻时才发现，那是通向所有梦境的起点。”

When her lips touched his neck,
the molecules in the air compressed,
forming a moment so important
it's like Newton's apple falling.

Like Einstein seeing the light,
the briefness of the moment lingers
as flames ignite in their hearts,
vibrating into waves and energy.

This moment marks the start
of a journey to all their dreams,
a key to unlock all that's ahead,
as fate's roulette wheel starts to spin.

Let's go towards the future together,
following love's footsteps to achieve,
as our hearts reach for the stars,
dreams come true in the endless universe.
